# WhatIfDemo-NodeJs

A simple Azure Function written in TypeScript, that makes a call to [WhatIfDemo-Functions](https://github.com/scale-tone/WhatIfDemo/tree/master/WhatIfDemo-Functions).

Demonstrates how to secure service-to-service calls with [Azure Managed Identities](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview). Uses [@azure/identity](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/identity) package for obtaining access tokens.
